% GINI computes the Gini coefficient and the Lorentz curve.
%
% Usage:
%   g = gini(pop,val)
%   [g,l] = gini(pop,val)
%   [g,l,a] = gini(pop,val)
%   ... = gini(pop,val,makeplot)
%
% Input and Output:
%   pop     A vector of population sizes of the different classes.
%   val     A vector of the measurement variable (e.g. income per capita)
%           in the diffrerent classes.
%   g       Gini coefficient.
%   l       Lorentz curve: This is a two-column array, with the left
%           column representing cumulative population shares of the
%           different classes, sorted according to val, and the right
%           column representing the cumulative value share that belongs to
%           the population up to the given class. The Lorentz curve is a
%           scatter plot of the left vs the right column.
%   a       Same as l, except that the components are not normalized to
%           range in the unit interval. Thus, the left column of a is the
%           absolute cumulative population sizes of the classes, and the
%           right colun is the absolute cumulative value of all classes up
%           to the given one.
%   makeplot  is a boolean, indicating whether a figure of the Lorentz
%           curve should be produced or not. Default is false.
%
% Example:
%   x = rand(100,1);
%   y = rand(100,1);
%   gini(x,y,true);             % random populations with random incomes
%   figure;
%   gini(x,ones(100,1),true);   % perfect equality
%
% Explanation:
%
%   The vectors pop and val must be equally long and must contain only
%   positive values (zeros are also acceptable). A typical application
%   would be that pop represents population sizes of some subgroups (e.g.
%   different countries or states), and val represents the income per
%   capita in this different subgroups. The Gini coefficient is a measure
%   of how unequally income is distributed between these classes. A
%   coefficient of zero means that all subgroups have exactly the same
%   income per capital, so there is no dispesion of income; A very large
%   coefficient would result if all the income accrues only to one subgroup
%   and all the remaining groups have zero income. In the limit, when the
%   total population size approaches infinity, but all the income accrues
%   only to one individual, the Gini coefficient approaches unity.
%
%   The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution. If
%   (x,y) is a point on the Lorenz curve, then the poorest x-share of the
%   population has the y-share of total income. By definition, (0,0) and
%   (1,1) are points on the Lorentz curve (the poorest 0% have 0% of total
%   income, and the poorest 100% [ie, everyone] have 100% of total income).
%   Equal distribution implies that the Lorentz curve is the 45 degree
%   line. Any inequality manifests itself as deviation of the Lorentz curve
%   from the  45 degree line. By construction, the Lorenz curve is weakly
%   convex and increasing.
%
%   The two concepts are related as follows: The Gini coefficient is twice
%   the area between the 45 degree line and the Lorentz curve.

    % Gini coefficient

    % We compute the area below the Lorentz curve. We do this by
    % computing the average of the left and right Riemann-like sums.
    % (I say Riemann-'like' because we evaluate not on a uniform grid, but
    % on the points given by the pop data).
    %
    % These are the two Rieman-like sums:
    %    leftsum  = sum(relz(1:end-1) .* diff(relpop));
    %    rightsum = sum(relz(2:end)   .* diff(relpop));
    % The Gini coefficient is one minus twice the average of leftsum and
    % rightsum. We can put all of this into one line.
